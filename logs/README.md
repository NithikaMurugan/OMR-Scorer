# Logs

This directory contains log files generated by the OMR-Scorer application.

## Log Files

- `omr_processing.log` - Main processing logs
- Other log files generated during application runtime

## Log Levels

The application may generate logs at different levels:
- **INFO**: General information about processing
- **WARNING**: Warnings about potential issues
- **ERROR**: Error messages
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information

## Log Rotation

For production use, consider implementing log rotation to manage log file sizes.

## Note

Log files are excluded from version control by the `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary commits of runtime data.
