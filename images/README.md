- **Processing Images**: Intermediate processing results
- **Comparison Images**: Side-by-side comparisons of algorithms

## Generated Files

Files in this directory are typically generated automatically by the various scripts in the project. Common patterns include:
- `bubble_debug*.jpg` - Bubble detection debug images
- `current_detection_analysis.png` - Current detection analysis results  
- `manual_vs_algorithm_comparison.jpg` - Algorithm comparison visualizations
- `debug_regions*.jpg` - Region detection debug images

## Note

Most files in this directory are temporary and for development purposes. They are excluded from version control by the `.gitignore` file.
